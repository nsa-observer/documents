ACRONYMS/DEFINITIONS:

(U) Computer Network Exploitation (CNE): intelligence collection and enabling operations to gather data from
target or adversary automated information systems (AIS) or networks. (Per DCID 7/3, Information Operations and
Intelligence Community Related Activities, effective 01 July 1999, administratively changed 5 June 2003)

(U) Computer Network Attack (CNA): operations to manipulate, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information
resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves. (Per DCID 7/3, Information
Operations and Intelligence Community Related Activities, effective 01 July 1999, administratively changed 5 June

US. and allied computers and networks. (Per DCID 7/3, Information Operations and Intelligence Community Related
Activities, effective 01 July 1999, administratively changed 5 June 2003)

(U) Computer Network Operations (CNO): CNE, CNA, and CND collectively. (Per DCID 7/3, Information
